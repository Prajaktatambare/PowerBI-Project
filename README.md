# PowerBI-Project
For this Power BI project, the insurance dataset was analyzed to explore key factors such as the count of incidents and the influence of time, gender, and vehicle age on claims. The analysis revealed patterns in claim frequency based on the time of occurrence, highlighting peak periods for incidents. Gender-based trends were also observed, providing insights into differences in claim submissions. Vehicle age was analyzed to understand its correlation with the likelihood of incidents, showing that older vehicles had a higher frequency of claims. The visualization highlights these relationships clearly, helping stakeholders identify risk factors and make informed decisions.
